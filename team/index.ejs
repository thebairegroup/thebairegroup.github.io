		    		<p> Dillon grew up in middle America and never in his wildest dreams did he think he’d be working on blockchain technologies during his lifetime. He’s spent too much time before this as a venture investor, a networked systems researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. He may or may not finish his business school degree. He loves reading books, so please find him on Twitter and suggest some books for him. </p>
